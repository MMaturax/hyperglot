# Q & A: Considerations when developing Hyperglot

WIP, please feel free to add your questions

## Orthographies instead of languages

## Why did not we cover regions?

## Why did not we include punctuation and numerals?

## Why sources are important

## Why a list of Unicode code points is not sufficient for language support by itself

## Is Hyperglot better than other similar databases and tools?
